# Twitter-Analytics-Dashboard-Power-BI


## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly Twitter Analytics Dashboard in Power BI that helps understand and track key Twitter metrics like tweet activity, audience engagement rates, retweets, likes, and views, etc. This will help make better decisions, improve content strategies, and boost overall social media performance.


## Tasks

1. Develop a chart that displays tweets with the highest engagement rates (top 10%). Include only those tweets that have received more than 50 likes and were posted on weekdays and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself as well as tweet character count should be below 30.

2. Build a chart to identify the top 10 tweets by the sum of retweets and likes. Filter out tweets posted on weekends and show the user profile that posted each tweet and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and the tweet impression should be even number and tweet date should be odd number as well as tweet word count be below 30

3. Develop a visualization that compares the number of replies, retweets, and likes for tweets that have received media engagements greater than the median value. Include a filter for tweets posted in between June and August of 2020 and this graph should work only between 3PM IST to 5 PM IST and 7 AM to 11AM apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself and tweet date should be odd number and media views should be even number as well as tweet character count should be above 20 and need to remove tweet word which has letter 'S'. 


## Conclusion

We successfully loaded Twitter data into Power BI and performed data cleaning and transformation to ensure accuracy and consistency. Through data manipulation, we resolved errors and removed any inaccuracies to prepare the dataset for analysis. Using the refined data, we created a visually appealing and interactive dashboard that effectively presented key insights. All tasks were completed efficiently and within the given timeframe, showcasing our ability to manage data and deliver results on time.
